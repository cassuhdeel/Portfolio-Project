# Portfolio-Project
Portfolio Project

This simple application was my first big project for Thinkful's Software Engineering program. It was designed to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS. By creating my own portfolio website it set me up for future employers to get to know and understand me better through work of my own.

The website is fairly simple and the links at the top take you to different parts of the page.

While making this project I was so excited to see what went into making webpages and a simple one such as this one opened my eyes to how much work and time goes into development.

My future goals for this project would be to make it a full=stack application with a front-end and back-end.

Enjoy!
